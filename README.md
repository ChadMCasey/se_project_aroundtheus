# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Figma
- Responsive Design

**Project Description**

Around the US is a web application designed to allow users to create profiles, add photos, and share places they have visited across the US with others. The goal of this project was to practice the fundamental skills needed to create responsive designs. For example, auto-fitting grids and flex boxes that alternate their flex-directions when presented with different screen sizes. The site has been optimized for two screen widths, 1280px & 320px, but the responsive design should keep the UI looking elegant across the screen sizes between these two values.
